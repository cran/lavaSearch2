* Version 1.1.0 <2018-02-01 Thu>
** User visible changes
 - The argument =numericDerivative= has been renamed =numeric.derivative=.
 - The argument =adjust.residuals= has been renamed =bias.correct=.
 - The method =dVcov2= has been renamed =sCorrect=.
 - The method =lTest= is now replaced by the method =compare2=.
   =compare2= is similar to =lava::compare= but with small sample correction.
   The argument =C= of =lTest= is now =contrast= in =compare2=.
 - The interaction with the multtest package has been re-organized. 
   There is no more =mlf2= or =mmm2= function. 
   When no small sample correction is needed use =glht=, otherwise =glht2=.
 - The function =createContrast= has been improved.

** Internal changes
 - When possible argument x has been converted to object.
 - Dependency on several packages has been moved from Import to
   Suggest.  This leads to several requireNamespace in the code to
   check the presence of packages.

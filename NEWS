* Version 1.2.0 <2018-03-16 Fri>
** User visible changes
- a function =leverage2= has been added. It enables to extract the
  leverage values from a =lvmfit= object.
- =sCorrect= can handle missing values.
- =sCorrect= now uses an iterative procedure to correct the residual
  variance-covariance matrix. This enables to match the results of
  =lm= and =t.test= with a =gls= or =lvmfit= object.
- The names of the methods for extracting the results after small
  sample correction all ends with a 2. This is suppose to avoid
  confusion for the user between the non-corrected results
  (e.g. obtained with =summary=) and the corrected resutls
  (e.g. obtained with =summary2=).

** Internal changes
- Reorganization of the small sample correction: now =sCorrect= is
now independent of =iid2=, =residuals2=, and =score2=. The correction
of the residual variance-covariance matrix is made in a separate
function =adjustEstimate= called by =sCorrect=. Then the corrected
score is computed by =.score2= and the first derivative of the
expected information matrix is computed by =dInformation2=.
- The test batterie has been re-organized

* Version 1.1.0 <2018-02-01 Thu>
** User visible changes
 - The argument =numericDerivative= has been renamed =numeric.derivative=.
 - The argument =adjust.residuals= has been renamed =bias.correct=.
 - The method =dVcov2= has been renamed =sCorrect=.
 - The method =lTest= is now replaced by the method =compare2=.
   =compare2= is similar to =lava::compare= but with small sample correction.
   The argument =C= of =lTest= is now =contrast= in =compare2=.
 - The interaction with the multtest package has been re-organized. 
   There is no more =mlf2= or =mmm2= function. 
   When no small sample correction is needed use =glht=, otherwise =glht2=.
 - The function =createContrast= has been improved.

** Internal changes
 - When possible argument x has been converted to object.
 - Dependency on several packages has been moved from Import to
   Suggest.  This leads to several requireNamespace in the code to
   check the presence of packages.
